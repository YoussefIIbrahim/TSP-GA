### Travelling Salesman Problem - Genetic Algorithm
An implementation of the genetic algorithm for the travelling salesman problem.
The code is constructed in OOP to separate the actual entities and manipulate the variables in each entity on its own.

#### Inspiration
The algorithm was written as a sort of practice and understanding of genetic algorithm and how it should work to optimize 
any NP-problem later on. The implementation is based on an article "Applying a genetic algorithm to the traveling salesman problem" by  LEE JACOBSON.

### Bugs
Currently working on fixing some bugs and setting the algorithm for a higher optimization fitness score.
